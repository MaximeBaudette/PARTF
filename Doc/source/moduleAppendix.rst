Appendix D: Pluggable Module Reference
#######################################

A pluggable module is a stand-alone module that can be launched by a
framework or other application then runs independent of the launching
application. Multiple clones of the same module type may be launched and
will coexist independent of each other. Module clones receive requests
from the launching framework or another application and broadcast
responses to any application that has registered to receive the modules
broadcasts.

Pluggability means that the module is able to support a wide range of
user-defined functionality by loading one of a class of plug-ins. this
allows modules to be, for example hardware abstracted versions of
different test instruments with (for example) ISI compliant APIs.
another example is creating a range of Matlab-based plug-ins where the
module can perform many different types of operations. Plug-ins can be
changed on-the-fly during runtime without needing to stop and restart
the module clone.

Quick Start using TestCloneAPI
==============================

To get a quick overview of how pluggable modules work, use the
TestCloneAPI.vi application:

|image0|

Figure : LabVIEW Project showing TestCloneAPI.vi

TestCloneAPI.vi is an application that can be used to test the modules
application programming interface (API) as it is being developed. It
provides example controls for launching multiple clones, loading plugins
and requesting a plugin’s .ini file path. This is a good application for
a programmer to add controls to test module functions as they are being
added. It is not a good example of a test framework which should be
based on a producer consumer pattern.

|image1|

Figure : TestCloneAPI.vi front panel

Using TestCloneAPI you can see how a clone is launched and removed, how
plugins are loaded or changed, and how a simple requests such as showing
or hiding the clone’s front panel or requesting the path to the current
plugin’s .ini file is sent to one or all clones. When multiple clones
are launched, the “Select Module to send request listbox will allow
requests to be sent to one or all modules.

Launching a Module Clone
========================

A framework application launches a clone of a module by passing a
reference to the module Main.vi to the StartClone.vi which launches the
clone. StartClone.vi outputs a cluster of the clone’s broadcast events
so they can be registered to allow the framework to receive broadcasts
from the clone. To be sure that the clone is ready to accept requests
from the framework, the ModuleAdmin class method WaitOnEventSync.vi
waits for a semaphore from the new clone indicating that the clone is
ready to accept requests. Following that, the semaphore reference must
be destroyed by ModuleAdmin:DestroySyncRefnums.vi

|image2|

Module Top Level: Main.vi
=========================

The Main.vi is the top level of the pluggable module. The path to
Main.vi is used by a framework which launches clones of the module to
load and run the module clone. Main.vi is organized as a queued message
handler (QMH) pattern which can also be considered a producer consumer
pattern. After creation of a new ModuleAdmin class instance (see the
documentation for the ModuleAdmin library), initialization of request
events and user events, and initialization of the queue to be used for
the QMH, two while loops are started. The upper loop is the event
handler loop (the producer) and the bottom loop is the queued message
handler (the consumer).

|image3|

Figure : Top Level: Main.vi

Start-up and initialization
===========================

|image4|

Figure : Module start up

The launching application passes in a new ModuleAdmin reference and the
new clone is added to the ModuleAdmin CloneRegistry. For more
information on the ModuleAdmin class see the ModuleAdmin documentation.
The next thing that happens is a set of request events and broadcast
events are initialized. the events are registered with the module.
Finally a queue is initialized and the Event Handler Loop and QMH loop
are started. When the Queue was initialized, an “Initialize” message was
placed in the Queue, so the Initialize state of the QMH will run
immediately.

|image5|

Figure : QMH "Initialize" state

Normally, a module will only be launched by a framework or application,
but they can be launched manuallyy as well. If launched manually,
ModuleAdmin:External Launch will be FALSE and the frontpanel will be
visible. If launched by an application, External Launch is TRUE and if
ShowPanel\_ is FALSE, the module frontpanel will be hidden (this is the
typical condition when using modules because they will not usually have
front panel controls. The fornt panel is set up then the module
synchronizes with the launching application using the
ModuleAdmin:WaitOnModuleSync and WaitOnEventSync methods. Finally the
module broadcasts a status message indicating to all applications
registered to receive broadcasts that it has initialized.

Requests
========

Handling Requests
+++++++++++++++++

|image6|

Figure : Responding to the ShowPanel Request

Requests are user events generated by a framework or application and
received by the module’s event handler loop. In Figure 6 a ShowPanel
event is shown in the event structure. The event carries the ModuleID
and a variant that can handle any type of data. The
ModuleAdmin:AddressedToThisModule method determines if the requests
ModuleID is -1 (all modules) or matches the ModuleID of this module. If
either of these are true, the “ShowPanel” command is enqueued into the
QMH’s ques along with the data variant.

In the QMH loop, when a command is found in the queue, it is input to
the QMH’s case statement. In Figure 6, the ShowPanel case is called and
the varient data is cast to a boolean value. Each command state should
know what datatype to expect so, for those commands with data, the first
thing that normally happens is the data variant is cast into the
appropriate datatype.

Creating New Request Types
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To create a new request type, begin by editing the clRequestEvents.ctl
typedef:

+------------+------------+
| |image7|   | |image8|   |
+------------+------------+

Figure : clRequestEvents Typedef

Copy one of the existing event references and rename it to the name of
your new request. Save or apply changes to the typedef.

If the data type is a cluster, or something other than a LabVIEW
primitive representation (string, double, etc) or array of primitives,
you will probably want to create a Typedef for the data type. The
typedef will need to have public access so a good place to put it would
be in PublicAPI/Arguments/Requests:

|image9|

Figure : PublicAPI/Arguments/Requests

Next, add an event case to the event handler loop. For many of the new
events, you can duplicate and modify another event such as the
“ShowPanel” event. Because you have saved a new request reference to the
clRequestEvents typedef, that event will now appear as one of the
choices for the new event.

|image10|

Figure : Adding an event case to the Event Handler Loop

When an event is generated by a framework or other application, the data
to be sent is flattened to a Variant type and sent to the event “Data”
pipe. The ModuleID is also sent along with the data. The ModuleID is
wired into a ModuleAdmin:AddressedToThisModule method and that in turn
to the selector of a case statement. Sometimes, a simple handler can be
written into the case statement, and sometimes a QMH command should be
created. The data variant type is wired into the Enqueue method and
outputs from the Dequeue method in the QMH loop. It will need to be
unflattened from the variant type to the data type using the typedef you
created earlier (or the LabVIEW primitive or array of primitives if you
did not need to make a typedef.)

Next, a Request method will need to be created to be used by a framework
or other app to generate the new request. Typically, you can start from
an existing request method such as the ShowPanelRequest shown below:

+-------------+-------------+
| |image11|   | |image12|   |
+-------------+-------------+

Figure : ShowPanelRequest example

Change the cluster unbundle on the output of ObtainRequestEvents method
the to your new request name, then replace the data input with a control
for your data type and save the request with a new name in
Protected\\Requests. When you use the request in a framework or other
app, the framework library will need to be a “friend” of the
PluggableModule library.

An example of how to make a request to a module is shown in the
TestCloneAPI application. note again that it is recommended that a
framework be constructed as a Queued Message Handler and the
TestCloneAPI is a very simple test app:

|image13|

Figure : Simple example of making a module request

A boolean toggle on the fron panel of the TestCloneAPI application
triggers an event, the active module number is placed into the
ShowPanelRequest ModuleID input and the new value of the toggle is
placed into the data input. the request event is generated and the
pluggable module responds by showing or hiding its frontpanel.

Broadcasts
==========

Similar to Requests, Broadcasts are user events. Broadcasts are
generated inside the pluggable module and may be received by the
framework or any application that registers to receive them. Multiple
applications can receive the broadcasts at the same time. When a
broadcast is generated, the broadcast data is placed into a separate
queue for each application that is registered to receive the broadcast.

Creating new broadcast types
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To create a new broadcast type, begin by editing the
clBroadcastEvents.ctl typedef:

+-------------+-------------+
| |image14|   | |image15|   |
+-------------+-------------+

Figure : clBroadcastEvents.ctl typedef

Copy one of the existing event references and rename it to the name of
your new broadcast. Save or apply changes to the typedef.

If the data type is a cluster, or something other than a LabVIEW
primitive representation (string, double, etc) or array of primitives,
you will probably want to create a Typedef for the data type. The
typedef will need to have public access so a good place to put it would
be in PublicAPI/Arguments/Broadcasts.

Next, create a new broadcast method. The best thing to do is to make a
copy of an existing broadcast method:

+-------------+-------------+
| |image16|   | |image17|   |
+-------------+-------------+

Figure : Broadcast Method

Change the cluster unbundle on the output of ObtainBrodcastEvents method
the to your new request name, then replace the data input with a control
for your data type and save the broadcast with a new name in
Protected\\Broadcasts. Quite often, a broadcast will be generated in
response to a request. An example of the PathToPlugin broadcast in
response to a PathToIni request is shown below:

|image18|

Figure : Example of a broadcast in response to a request.

Plugin Classes
==============

Plugins are abstracted classes that do the core work of any module.
Abstracted means that plugins can be created to perform similar
operations for which an application programming interface (API) has been
created using different hardware, computer languages, or procedures.
Here are some examples of how plugins can be used:

-  Modules can be created supporting IVI\ :sup:`TM`
   (http://www.ivifoundation.org/) compliant APIs with plugins
   supporting a variety of hardware. New hardware can later be added to
   support the same instrument functionality.

-  Generic modules can be created with a common API for various system
   models and plugins for each system can be created. An example is an
   event on the electrical power system. plugins can be created to model
   different kinds of events on different power system topologies, for
   example a phase step transient in an IEEE Bus model may be one
   plugin, while a Line to line fault on an existing model of a section
   of an actual power system may be another plugin.

-  Measurement algorithms can be created as plugins. For example a
   Phasor Measurement Unit module can support different plugins for
   algorithms such as frequency tracking or non-frequency tracking.

Plugins can be created to support computer languages such as Matlab,
Python, any of the C variants, etc. Users can then create new plugins
without needing to know anything about Labview programming.

A new plugin consists of:

-  A child class of the PluginsBase Class

-  A .ini file providing a relative path to the plugin child class and a
   name for the Plugin Type. The init file can also contain other
   information such as default configuration and parameter values. The
   path to the .ini file is available to the framework or any
   application via a module request/broadcast.

-  Any plugin method overrides created by the plugin designer.

Plugin Methods
==============

The work of the plugin is done by plugin methods. You will create a set
of plugin methods in the base class that throw an error because base
class plugins methods should always be overridden by child class
methods. LabVIEW requires that overridable methods have Public Access.
You will likely create public methods to write and read plugin
parameters and/or configuration information and to get plugin output. A
variant datatype property has been added to the BasePlugin properties as
an example. This can later be changed to another typedef for your
BasePlugin. You will likely add other parameter and configuration
properties to the BasePlugin based on the typedefs you create for those
data types.

+-------------+-------------+
| |image19|   | |image20|   |
+-------------+-------------+

Figure : Sample “PluginOutput” variant datatype added to BasePlugin
properties

Creating an new base plugin method
===================================

Most plugin methods will be “must override” methods in the Base Plugin.
The entire collection of base plugin methods can be considered as the
“API of the plugin. New plugins will override these methods to provide
the abstracted functionality of the module. As an example, here are the
steps that go into creating the sample “PluginMethod” Generally plugin
methods will be evoked by a request and will generate a broadcast, so
begin by creating new requests and broadcasts per sections 4.2.2 and
4.3.1:

+-------------+-------------+
| |image21|   | |image22|   |
+-------------+-------------+

Figure : PluginOutput request and broadcast have been added to the
typedefs

Create the Request and Broadcast vis:

+-------------+-------------+
| |image23|   | |image24|   |
+-------------+-------------+

Figure : Request and Broadcast VIs

Create a plugin base class method that throws an error if it is not
overridden. The base object class provides a good error module to use:

|image25|

Figure : Example Base Plugin Method throws an error if called

This method must have public assess. The class input and output
terminals must be dynamic.

Next, add an event handler and QMH loop case to the modules “Main.vi to
handle the request event and run the base plugin method:

|image26|

Figure : Event Handler and QMH case for the new method

The QMH handler calls the GetOutput method which will put the output
into the PluginOutput method. If the method does not throw an error (for
example by calling the Base Class method) PluginOutput property is input
to the PluginOutput broadcast vi along with the ModuleAdmin:ModuleID
property. Optionally, the handler broadcasts a status message that the
output has been transmitted. This status broadcast is useful for logging
or debugging the framework or other applications.

You will want to test each method you add to the modules API so add a
button that sends the request to the TestCloneAPI application:

|image27|

If you run the TestCloneAPI, add a clone and press the GetPluginOutput
button, you will get the following expected error:

|image28|

Figure : the error you will get if you call a BasePluginClass method
that has not been overrridden

Next you will create a child plugin class and override the method.

1. Creating a new Plugin Child Class

Begin by creating a new class and setting it to inherit from the
BasePlugin class:

|image29|

Figure : Creating a new Plugin child class

Under the properties for the new class, change the inheritance to the
BasePluginClass:

|image30|

Figure : Setting the inheritance of the child plugin class

Create new overrides for all plugin methods you may have created in the
base plugin class:

|image31|

Edit the override vis for the special functionality of the plugin. for
the example Module Output method, we will simply broadcast a string:

|image32|

Figure : Override for the GetOutput method

We chose to make the PluginOutput property into a variant to we are
putting a string into the variant. We could have chosen to make the
property a string type (or any other typedef or primative).

Next create a plugin .ini file that contains a relative path to the
plugin “lvclass” file and a name for the plugin type:

|image33|

Figure : Sample Plugin .ini file

The SamplePlugin child class only has an empty property control. A .ini
file, and overrides for the base plugin methods:

|image34|

Now when you run the TestCloneAPI, Add a Clone, select the Sample
Plugin, load the Plugin, then Get the Plugin Output, the ModuleOutput
indicator will show the string that came from the Sample Plugin method.
